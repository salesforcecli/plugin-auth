# summary

Log out of a Salesforce org.

# description

If you run this command with no flags, it first displays a list of orgs you've created or logged into, with none of the orgs selected. Use the arrow keys to scroll through the list and the space bar to select the orgs you want to log out of. Press Enter when you're done; the command asks for a final confirmation before logging out of the selected orgs.

The process is similar if you specify --all, except that in the initial list of orgs, they're all selected. Use --target-org to logout of a specific org. In both these cases by default, you must still confirm that you want to log out. Use --no-prompt to never be asked for confirmation when also using --all or --target-org.

Be careful! If you log out of a scratch org without having access to its password, you can't access the scratch org again, either through the CLI or the Salesforce UI.

# examples

- Interactively select the orgs to log out of:

  <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %>

- Log out of the org with username me@my.org:

  <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --target-org me@my.org

- Log out of all orgs after confirmation:

  <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --all

- Logout of the org with alias my-scratch and don't prompt for confirmation:

  <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --target-org my-scratch --no-prompt
