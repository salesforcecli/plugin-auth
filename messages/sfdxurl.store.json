  "description": "Authorize an org using an SFDX auth URL\nAuthorize a Salesforce org using an SFDX auth URL stored within a file. The URL must have the format \"%s\" or \"%s\".\nYou have three options when creating the auth file. The easiest option is to redirect the output of the `sfdx force:org:display --verbose --json` command into a file.\nFor example, using an org you have already authorized:\n\n    $ sfdx force:org:display -u <DevHub> --verbose --json > authFile.json\n    $ sfdx auth:sfdxurl:store -f authFile.json\n\nThe resulting JSON file contains the URL in the sfdxAuthUrl property inside of a results object.\nYou can also create a JSON file that has a top-level property named sfdxAuthUrl whose value is the auth URL.\nFinally, you can create a normal text file that includes just the URL and nothing else.",
